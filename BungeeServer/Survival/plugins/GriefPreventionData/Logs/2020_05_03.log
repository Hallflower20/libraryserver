23:58 Math0424  :  placed a sign @ world: x445, z552
  You cant read it
  lol.
11:28 DavidTheStarman: shopkeeper give DavidTheStarman 64
11:54 DavidTheStarman: test
12:25 DavidTheStarman: hey, iamthecaleb, can you help me test something?
12:26 iamthecaleb    : What do you want david
12:26 DavidTheStarman: I'm setting up a plugin that lets players create shops, I need someone to test it
12:27 iamthecaleb    : Ok
12:27 iamthecaleb    : Signs?
12:27 DavidTheStarman: this plugin works will villagers and signs
12:27 iamthecaleb placed suspicious WATER_BUCKET @ world: x477, z747
12:28 DavidTheStarman: so I need you to take a chest, a villager spawn egg, and follow the instructions to make a shop
12:28 iamthecaleb    : Ok
12:29 DavidTheStarman: when you hold the egg in your hand, it should give you some instructions to use it
12:30 DavidTheStarman: the villagers can't move
12:30 DavidTheStarman: they won't escape
12:30 DavidTheStarman: looks like it worked
12:30 DavidTheStarman: put items that you want to sell in the chest
12:31 DavidTheStarman: then shift-right-click on the villager to edit the prices
12:31 DavidTheStarman: can you set up a couple trades so we can test them?
12:32 iamthecaleb    : I think it works
12:32 DavidTheStarman: yeah, it worked!
12:33 DavidTheStarman: thanks!
12:33 iamthecaleb    : Ya
12:33 iamthecaleb    : How will people get emeralds though?
12:34 DavidTheStarman: I think I'm going to set up a shop at spawn where players can sell valuables for emeralds
12:34 iamthecaleb    : Gotcha
12:34 DavidTheStarman: the plugin lets you set up shops that work in reverse
12:34 iamthecaleb    : How?
12:35 DavidTheStarman: hold a spawn egg in your hand, then look at what the instructions say. The first two lines let you change what type of shop it is
12:35 DavidTheStarman: you can choose if the shop is a villager or sign, and you can choose if the shop sells, buys, or trades
12:35 iamthecaleb    : Unfortunate that I do not have a second spawn egg
12:35 DavidTheStarman: now you do
12:35 iamthecaleb    : Gratzi
12:36 iamthecaleb    : There are a lot of variants
12:36 DavidTheStarman: or, if players don't have emeralds, they can use the trade option so you can use diamonds or iron as currency
12:36 iamthecaleb    : Yea I saw that
12:37 DavidTheStarman: so I think I won't setup a shop at spawn where you can sell iron and diamonds for emeralds
12:37 iamthecaleb    : Yea
12:37 DavidTheStarman: emeralds do spawn naturally, and you can get them from vanilla villagers. Other shops could just use iron or diamonds
12:37 DavidTheStarman: I will need to make one that sells Villager spawn eggs though
12:37 iamthecaleb    : Yes
12:38 iamthecaleb    : And you need to make a currency exchange
12:38 DavidTheStarman: maybe
12:38 iamthecaleb    : x Iron= x diamond=x emerald
12:38 DavidTheStarman: the trouble with using emeralds and iron is that both are farmable
12:39 DavidTheStarman: I think I might just change all shops to use diamonds instead
12:39 iamthecaleb    : But then you have a harder to aquire currency and thus you would have to set up an exchange feature
12:40 DavidTheStarman: idk, diamonds aren't that hard to get
12:40 DavidTheStarman: and early game, they might even be easier than emeralds
12:40 iamthecaleb    : No there's a village in the taiga biome
12:40 iamthecaleb    : And a cartographer
12:40 DavidTheStarman: and if there is a currency exchange, then now diamonds are just as farmable as emeralds or iron
12:40 iamthecaleb    : It would be better to have it that you can trade diamonds for emeralds rather than vice versa
12:41 iamthecaleb    : Since emeralds are only inherently valuable for their trade value
12:41 DavidTheStarman: but again, diamonds are one of the only valuable items in the game that is not farmable
12:41 iamthecaleb    : But they're not common enough to be able to used as a currency
12:41 DavidTheStarman: arent they?
12:42 DavidTheStarman: diamond's aren't that hard to get
12:42 iamthecaleb    : Not in my opinion
12:42 DavidTheStarman: ok, I'm gonna open a poll on the discord. I'll let democracy decide this.
12:42 iamthecaleb    : Ok
12:47 iamthecaleb    : Also I have noticed villager egg does not return to inventory if you delete it
12:47 DavidTheStarman: yeah, I'm gonna fix that.
12:49 iamthecaleb    : Also chests that are placed on chests do not connect
12:49 DavidTheStarman: oh yeah, that was a change a couple updates ago.
12:50 DavidTheStarman: thats not because of the plugin
12:50 iamthecaleb    : Nvm I figured it out
12:56 DavidTheStarman: can you check now, if the spawn eggs are returned when you delete a shop?
12:56 iamthecaleb    : Yes
12:56 iamthecaleb    : they do
12:56 DavidTheStarman: great, thanks
12:56 DavidTheStarman: also, the poll is up
12:56 iamthecaleb    : No problem
12:57 iamthecaleb    : I'm not part of the discord XD
12:57 DavidTheStarman: the link is shown in the TAB list
12:57 iamthecaleb    : I know and I could ask mathieu at any time for it but I'm too lazy
13:01 iamthecaleb    : Also the discord link does not work
13:01 DavidTheStarman: oh, we will fix that before we launch tomorr
13:01 iamthecaleb    : ZwVw2C
13:01 DavidTheStarman: *tomorrow
13:01 DavidTheStarman: I also need to build an Imperial Star Destroyer and a few X-Wings above spawn for Star Wars day
13:01 iamthecaleb    : I miss the times when AFK plugin was not a thing
13:02 iamthecaleb    : Also David, Diamonds are not common
13:02 iamthecaleb    : I only have 15
13:03 DavidTheStarman: how many hours have you been mining?
13:03 iamthecaleb    : A few
13:03 DavidTheStarman: can I see your mine? Maybe you are using the innefficient method
13:03 iamthecaleb    : No I am using the most efficient method
13:03 DavidTheStarman: this isnt it
13:03 DavidTheStarman: watch me
13:04 iamthecaleb    : But that way is gross
13:04 DavidTheStarman: this method maximizes the surface area of your mine, while minimizing the number of blocks you mine
13:05 iamthecaleb    : This way creates long tunnels while also minimizing the number of blocks I have to mine
13:06 DavidTheStarman: you should see the mines I make on my survival world
13:07 iamthecaleb    : I like my mining method, much easy to walk through
13:07 DavidTheStarman: btw, the discord vote is open and we have 5 votes so far
13:07 DavidTheStarman: 4 for diamond, 1 for emerald
13:07 iamthecaleb    : Trade?
13:08 iamthecaleb    : Trade question mark
13:10 iamthecaleb placed suspicious WATER_BUCKET @ world: x477, z747
13:11 DavidTheStarman: Shopkeeper
13:12 iamthecaleb    : David can you spot me some books? Or will I have to make them myself?
13:13 DavidTheStarman: you mean you want me to get books for you?
13:13 DavidTheStarman: like from a villager?
13:13 iamthecaleb    : What?
13:13 DavidTheStarman: I don't get what you mean
13:13 iamthecaleb    : Nvm I'll just make the books
13:14 iamthecaleb placed suspicious WATER_BUCKET @ world: x477, z752
13:23 DavidTheStarman: hey, so right now diamonds are winning. How much should a shop cost in diamonds?
13:23 iamthecaleb    : How hard do you want it to be to get a shop?
13:23 iamthecaleb    : I would say 1-5 for easy
13:23 iamthecaleb    : 5-10 for medium
13:24 DavidTheStarman: hard enough that people don't spam them, easy enough that people can get multiple villagers for larger shops
13:24 iamthecaleb    : 15
13:24 iamthecaleb    : Maybe less
13:24 DavidTheStarman: 15 diamonds?
13:24 iamthecaleb    : 10-15
13:25 DavidTheStarman: I was gonna go for 3-5
13:25 iamthecaleb    : why would people spam villagers?
13:25 iamthecaleb    : If you want to keep people from spamming villagers then it would have to be higher than 5
13:26 DavidTheStarman: I'm not that worried about spam though, I'm gonna make it 5 diamonds for a villager
13:26 iamthecaleb    : Ok sounds good
13:26 DavidTheStarman: if people complain, I can easily lower it
13:26 iamthecaleb    : 3 is like deciding whether to make a pickaxe or not
13:26 iamthecaleb    : Alternatively david
13:27 iamthecaleb    : david can you spot me like 2-3 bones
13:27 DavidTheStarman: what should I name the villager at spawn? the one that sells the villager eggs
13:28 iamthecaleb    : I don't have any on me and I just spotted a wolf
13:28 iamthecaleb    : Name him Carl
13:28 DavidTheStarman: he works a camera
13:28 iamthecaleb    : Gratzi
13:28 DavidTheStarman: Carl
13:28 iamthecaleb    : Oh then just name him Razzi
13:29 DavidTheStarman: "he works a camera" was a Phineas and Ferb reference
13:29 iamthecaleb    : Oh It's been too long David
13:29 DavidTheStarman: do you get it now?
13:29 iamthecaleb    : No I don't remember
13:29 DavidTheStarman: Carl was the intern with the glasses
13:29 iamthecaleb    : Oh yes I remember Carl
13:29 iamthecaleb    : I didn't remember the camera portion
13:30 DavidTheStarman: he worked the camera for when Major Monogram was talking to Perry
13:30 iamthecaleb    : I remember that too Carl the unpaid intern
13:30 iamthecaleb    : I don't remember the camera line though
13:32 DavidTheStarman: so what else should Carl sell?
13:32 iamthecaleb    : Gold shovels
13:32 DavidTheStarman: oh yeah
13:32 iamthecaleb    : My brother lost his and now he can't claim land
13:32 DavidTheStarman: we were going to have those in the kit though
13:32 iamthecaleb    : Ah that's smart
13:32 iamthecaleb    : Then no golden shovel
13:33 iamthecaleb    : Different types of vegetables?
13:33 DavidTheStarman: I don't want him to just sell things that you might want in survival mode. I want him to sell things related to our plugins and such
13:34 DavidTheStarman: so I'll add the golden shovel. You get your first one free in the kit when you join, but then you can buy additional ones for 1 iron or something
13:34 DavidTheStarman: or you could just make a golden shovel
13:34 iamthecaleb    : Yea will you get the kit more than once?
13:35 DavidTheStarman: no. you get the kit once, it probably will contain the golden shovel, some leather armor and stone tools
13:35 iamthecaleb    : Ok then yes definitely put in the golden shovel and sell for maybe 3 iron?
13:35 DavidTheStarman: oh, it looks like Math already made the kit
13:35 iamthecaleb    : YEah
13:36 iamthecaleb    : The kit only contained the golden shovel and bread I think
13:36 DavidTheStarman: and a wooden sword
13:36 DavidTheStarman: that seems like enough to me
13:36 iamthecaleb    : Oh yea
13:36 iamthecaleb    : Maybe a few seeds
13:36 iamthecaleb    : Since the weeds around spawn will eventually be cleared out by people looking for seeds
13:37 iamthecaleb    : Also when I fell asleep on the bed during the thunderstorm thunderstorm was still there
13:37 DavidTheStarman: still, you shouldn't need to go very far to get seeds. And what will you buy the seeds with anyway?
13:37 iamthecaleb    : No I mean include it in the kit
13:37 DavidTheStarman: also, yeah, because of the 1-player-sleep datapack we are using sleeping does not reset the weather anymore
13:38 iamthecaleb    : Ah
13:38 iamthecaleb    : Maybe eventually you can add more plug ins and add it to the villager
13:38 iamthecaleb    : Right now only the golden shovel and villager eggs sound prudent
13:40 DavidTheStarman: yeah
13:42 DavidTheStarman: looks like I need to restart the server for my changes to FirstJoinPlus to take effect
13:42 iamthecaleb    : First join plus?
13:42 DavidTheStarman: yeah, its the plugin that manages the kits you get when you first join
13:43 iamthecaleb    : Gotcha
13:43 DavidTheStarman: I made a few changes to the kit, but when I tested it it did not change
13:43 iamthecaleb    : WShat kind of changes/w
13:43 DavidTheStarman: I added wheat seeds to the kit, I made it not say "hello future friends" when you join, and I made it not give you speed
13:43 DavidTheStarman: but when I tested it just now, no change
13:43 iamthecaleb    : I thought the speed was a nice touch
13:44 DavidTheStarman: I found it annoying
13:44 iamthecaleb    : It can allow you to get past claimed land quickly
13:44 iamthecaleb    : Though i suppose that won't be much of a problem in the beginning
13:44 DavidTheStarman: true, but we want players to stick around for a bit to read the rules and server info
13:44 iamthecaleb    : I couldn't read server info
13:44 iamthecaleb    : Has that been fixed
13:44 DavidTheStarman: see it now?
13:44 iamthecaleb    : No
13:45 DavidTheStarman: what does it say?
13:45 iamthecaleb    : You can't read it lol
13:45 DavidTheStarman: you don't have permission to read from the lectern?
13:45 iamthecaleb    : No it's a problem I asked mathieu about last night
13:45 DavidTheStarman: ok, I figure he will fix it soon
13:45 iamthecaleb    : Yea
13:46 DavidTheStarman: otherwise, I can just have players spawn with a book that has the rules in it
13:46 iamthecaleb    : That's true
13:47 iamthecaleb    : Are just you Xander and Mathieu admins?
13:47 DavidTheStarman: yes
13:47 iamthecaleb    : Gotcha so Brandon and I will be on our own?
13:51 iamthecaleb    : How long until you get kicked from AFK?
13:52 DavidTheStarman: I don't think we kick for AFK at all.
13:52 DavidTheStarman: I'm not against AFK
13:52 iamthecaleb    : No Mathieu installed a plug yesterday
13:53 iamthecaleb    : I understand why because it lets people artifically inflate their playtime
13:53 iamthecaleb    : =more claimable land
13:53 iamthecaleb    : But it's also a pain because I want to AFK fish
13:53 DavidTheStarman: oh yeah, I see it
13:53 DavidTheStarman: I'm gonna ask him about it
13:54 iamthecaleb    : I could ask him XD
13:54 DavidTheStarman: I already put in a message to him on Discord
13:55 DavidTheStarman: oh, he is typing his reply
13:56 DavidTheStarman: Mathieu seems to really not like AFKing
13:57 iamthecaleb    : Darn XD
13:57 iamthecaleb    : I guess I have no choice but to actually fish
13:57 DavidTheStarman: oh, it seems Xander is against it too
13:58 DavidTheStarman: they think that the hardware the Library will use to run the server will not be as good as what it is running on now, so the AFKing is likely to cause lag
13:58 iamthecaleb    : AAh
13:58 DavidTheStarman: the server is already using like 40 threads
13:59 DavidTheStarman: Math has it set to 10 minutes before you get kicked for AFK
14:08 iamthecaleb    : NOOOOOOOO
14:36 iamthecaleb: Will mobs kill my villagers?
14:36 DavidTheStarman: no, villagers spawned by the shop plugin are invulnerable
14:37 iamthecaleb    : Also RIP my wolf dissapeared
14:37 iamthecaleb    : Disappeared*
14:40 DavidTheStarman: yeah, I just spawned a bunch of pillagers to see if they tried to kill your shopkeepers
14:40 DavidTheStarman: they didn't even try
14:40 iamthecaleb    : Gotcha
14:41 DavidTheStarman: are you building a shop here?
14:41 iamthecaleb    : I might
14:42 DavidTheStarman: its a bit close

18:58 Math0424       : you just lost her XP
18:58 Math0424       : all of it at that
18:59 DavidTheStarman: I deserve that
18:59 DavidTheStarman: I'm sorry
18:59 Math0424       : odd then
18:59 Math0424       : it says you have tp
18:59 DavidTheStarman: well, I don't
18:59 DavidTheStarman: maybe you didn't actually remove Op?
18:59 Math0424       : try now
18:59 Math0424       : rejoin
18:59 Math0424       : i removed it
18:59 DavidTheStarman: maybe you didn't actually remove Op
18:59 Math0424       : i removed OP, you cant even type /op
18:59 Math0424       : there
18:59 DavidTheStarman: yeah, it worked
19:00 Math0424       : apparently MC has 2 nodes
19:00 Math0424       : tp and teleport
19:00 Math0424       : tp does nothing
19:00 DavidTheStarman: maybe I was able to use /teleport the whole time
19:00 DavidTheStarman: but why can't I use the selector?
19:00 Math0424       : try now
19:00 Math0424       : @p
19:00 DavidTheStarman: "selector not allowed"
19:01 Math0424       : huh
19:01 Math0424       : didnt know it has perms
19:01 Math0424       : cool
19:01 Math0424       : there
19:01 Math0424       : selector perms
19:01 DavidTheStarman: it worked
19:01 DavidTheStarman: house looks nice
19:02 Math0424       : gotta fix the time thing too, for 50%
19:02 Math0424       : not 1 person
19:02 DavidTheStarman: can we have a message in chat when not enough players are sleeping that explains why its not going to day?
19:03 Math0424       : i can change everything
19:03 Math0424       : because plugin
19:04 DavidTheStarman: what if you only needed 1 player to fast forward, but the speed of the night depends on what proportion of online players were sleeping?
19:06 Math0424       : you cant use /time right?
19:06 DavidTheStarman: nope
19:06 Math0424       : good
19:06 DavidTheStarman: but I can use weather
19:06 DavidTheStarman: also, shouldnt admins be able to set the time?
19:06 Math0424       : absolutly not
19:06 DavidTheStarman: why?
19:06 Math0424       : ./time set day, set day to 0
19:07 DavidTheStarman: what do you mean?
19:07 Math0424       : f3 meu
19:07 Math0424       : day count
19:07 Math0424       : ./time set day
19:07 Math0424       : will set it to 0
19:07 Math0424       : cuz mojang lazy
19:07 DavidTheStarman: oh, so then we should only allow time subtract and add
19:07 Math0424       : new commad will be skipnight
19:08 Math0424       : its all one node david
19:08 DavidTheStarman: oh
19:08 Math0424       : time permission
19:08 DavidTheStarman: come on Mojang
19:08 cutepink2505   : excuse moi
19:12 Math0424       : bad david
19:12 Math0424       : dont mess with the natrual mc world
19:12 Math0424       : it ignores people in creative
19:13 Math0424       : or vanished
19:13 Math0424       : the skipnight
19:14 DavidTheStarman: hi

19:16 cutepink2505   : /msg Coco0422 hi 
19:17 Coco0422       : hi
19:17 Ghastslayer    : /msg Coco0422 hi 
19:17 Coco0422       : /msg 
19:20 Math0424       : ./co i
19:24 Math0424       : thinking of allowing PVP
19:24 Ghastslayer    : yes
19:24 Math0424       : but not on claims
19:24 Ghastslayer    : no
19:24 DavidTheStarman: no. we have a pvp arena
19:25 Math0424       : but we also have survival
19:25 DavidTheStarman: and we have a survival duels plugin
19:25 Ghastslayer    : David, stop not letting us do anything fun
19:25 Math0424       : lemme just mute him real quick
19:25 Math0424       : ok as i was saying
19:25 DavidTheStarman: I'm cool with pvp in the survival world, so long as it is limited to mutual accepted duels
19:25 Math0424       : why just that though
19:26 DavidTheStarman: because I don't want people getting attacked
19:26 Math0424       : you can attack them with lava
19:26 Math0424       : or tnt
19:26 Math0424       : or literally anything dangerous
19:26 DavidTheStarman: and we ban players for that kind of behavior
19:26 iamthecaleb    : Have no fear
19:26 iamthecaleb    : FOR I AM HERE
19:26 Math0424       : exactly so then pvp would be fine since its the same
19:27 iamthecaleb    : ???
19:27 Math0424       : ignore us
19:27 iamthecaleb    : No I'm listening
19:27 Math0424       : :|
19:27 iamthecaleb    : What did brandon do this time?
19:27 iamthecaleb    : Ghast?
19:27 DavidTheStarman: wait, so you are ok with enabling pvp because we will ban perpetrators?
19:27 iamthecaleb    : /pm ghastslayer 
19:27 Math0424       : well you just said that about lava dumping and flint and steel, if people want to kill eachother they will
19:27 iamthecaleb    : Ghast where are you?
19:28 Math0424       : you cant disable murder
19:28 DavidTheStarman: yes, but why make it easier to break the rules?
19:28 Math0424       : its not against the rules to pvp
19:28 DavidTheStarman: it is if the one or more of the players involved does not want to pvp
19:28 Math0424       : then they dont?
19:29 DavidTheStarman: and what if the other players don't respect their wishes?
19:29 Math0424       : ima change it to a toggle
19:29 Math0424       : then they can opt in or out
19:30 DavidTheStarman: thats fine then
19:30 Math0424       : default will be in
19:30 DavidTheStarman: no, default is out
19:30 Math0424       : in
19:30 DavidTheStarman: how do you toggle it?
19:30 Math0424       : dunno
